# Article Migration Format (JSON)

The following JSON specification provides an intermediate step between articles from a legacy system and their representation in Graf.ly's data model. It serves the dual purpose of answering the "how to migrate" and "what to migrate" questions which arise while implementing a bulk migration process into Graf.ly.

## Reasoning

This format answers the "how to migrate" question by representing the **output of existing rules** used by the legacy _frontend_ when interpreting the various article attributes. The primary purpose of the specification is thus to **remove ambiguities**.

The "what to migrate" question is handled by separating attributes which are relevant for Graf.ly's data model from attributes which are only relevant to the _frontend_ layer, while eliminating irrelevant attributes altogether. The secondary purpose of the specification is thus to **remove uncertainty** from the migration process, while helping identify requirements not covered by Graf.ly's data model (ensuring these issues can be dealt with appropriately).
