# Article Migration Format (JSON)

The following JSON specification provides an intermediate step between articles from a legacy system and their representation in Graf.ly's data model. It serves the dual purpose of answering the "how to migrate" and "what to migrate" questions which arise while implementing a bulk migration process into Graf.ly.

## Reasoning

This format answers the "how to migrate" question by representing the **output of existing rules** used by the legacy _frontend_ when interpreting the various article attributes. The primary purpose of the specification is thus to **remove ambiguities**.

The "what to migrate" question is handled by separating attributes which are relevant for Graf.ly's data model from attributes which are only relevant to the _frontend_ layer, while eliminating irrelevant attributes altogether. The secondary purpose of the specification is thus to **remove uncertainty** from the migration process, while helping identify requirements not covered by Graf.ly's data model (ensuring these issues can be dealt with appropriately).

## Structure

Each article is represented by three main blocks:

* `content` - Main article content after interpretation by legacy _frontend_ rules (if any), in display order.
* `metadata` - Additional article attributes with _frontend_-defined positioning, which may or may not be displayed.
* `objects` - Objects referenced by the article, which represent separate entities from the article itself. This block makes the article self-contained but, during a mass migration, objects may be included only when they're first referenced, thus saving space in subsequent articles. Duplicate objects across articles are only migrated once.

## Specification

### Notes
* URL attributes must be ASCII-only (URL-encoded).
* Time attributes are in UNIX format (seconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`).
* The article's `content` may be omitted (along with its `metadata` and `taxonomies`), turning it into a stub. When this is the case, its `objects` are migrated as normal but no actual article is created in Graf.ly. The `id` is the only mandatory attribute, which must always be unique for the whole article set.
